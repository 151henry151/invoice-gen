# Codebase Improvements and Technical Debt

## Code Organization and Structure

1. **Monolithic Application Structure**
   - The entire application logic is in a single `app.py` file (1043 lines)
   - Consider splitting into modules:
     - `routes/` for route handlers
     - `services/` for business logic
     - `utils/` for helper functions
     - `config.py` for configuration

2. **Template Organization**
   - Large template files (`index.html`: 102KB, `create_invoice.html`: 108KB)
   - Consider breaking down into smaller, reusable components
   - Implement template inheritance more effectively
   - Move JavaScript to separate files

3. **Backup Files**
   - Remove `app.py.bak` and `app.py.bak2` from version control
   - Add to `.gitignore`

## Security Concerns

1. **Session Management**

   - Implement proper CSS organization
   - Add responsive design improvements

3. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Add loading states
   - Improve error messages
   - Add proper form validation feedback
   - Implement proper mobile responsiveness

## Development Environment

# Issue #29: Fix: Default quantity for invoice items shows 1 but calculates as 0

**State:** OPEN
**Created:** 2025-06-02T02:43:45Z
**Updated:** 2025-06-02T13:51:02Z

## Bug Description

When adding a non-labor item to an invoice, the quantity field appears to default to 1 in the UI, but if the user doesn't explicitly adjust the quantity, the system calculates the price using a quantity of 0.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to the invoice creation page
2. Add a new non-labor item
3. Observe that the quantity field shows '1'
4. Add the item to the invoice without adjusting the quantity
5. The total price will be calculated as if quantity was 0

## Expected Behavior
- The default quantity should be 1
- The price calculation should use the displayed quantity value
- If no quantity is specified, it should default to 1

## Technical Details
- This appears to be a frontend-backend synchronization issue
- The UI shows a default value that doesn't match the actual value being sent to the backend
- Need to verify the form submission data and backend calculation logic

## Priority
High - This affects core invoice functionality and could lead to incorrect billing

## Labels
- bug
- high-priority
- frontend
- backend

# Issue #28: Fix: Selected client/business information unexpectedly clears

**State:** OPEN
**Created:** 2025-06-02T02:27:36Z
**Updated:** 2025-06-02T13:51:21Z

## Bug Description

The selected client or business information unexpectedly clears in certain circumstances, causing users to lose their selections and potentially lose work in progress.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to the invoice creation page
2. Select a client and/or business
3. Perform certain actions (specific actions need to be identified)
4. Observe that the selections are cleared

## Expected Behavior
- Selected client and business should persist throughout the invoice creation process
- Selections should only clear when explicitly requested by the user
- If selections must be cleared for technical reasons, user should be notified

## Technical Details
- This may be related to session management
- Could be caused by race conditions in the selection saving process
- Need to investigate the client-side state management
- Need to verify the server-side session handling

## Impact
- Users may lose work in progress
- Creates a poor user experience
- May lead to incorrect invoice creation

## Priority
High - This affects core functionality and user experience

## Labels
- bug
- high-priority
- frontend
- backend
- user-experience

# Issue #27: Fix: Keyboard navigation in dropdowns accidentally triggers create new pages

**State:** OPEN
**Created:** 2025-06-02T02:25:51Z
**Updated:** 2025-06-02T13:51:50Z

## Bug Description

When using keyboard navigation in the client/business selection dropdown, pressing the down arrow key can accidentally trigger navigation to the "create new" pages, disrupting the user's workflow.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to the invoice creation page
2. Click on the client or business dropdown
3. Use the keyboard down arrow to navigate through options
4. Observe that pressing down can accidentally navigate to the create new client/business page

## Expected Behavior
- Keyboard navigation should only move through the dropdown options
- Navigation to create new pages should require explicit user action
- Dropdown should maintain focus until a selection is made or it is closed

## Technical Details
- This appears to be a focus management issue
- The dropdown may be losing focus during keyboard navigation
- Need to verify the event handling for keyboard navigation
- May need to implement proper focus trapping in the dropdown

## Impact
- Disrupts keyboard-only users' workflow
- Forces users to use mouse navigation
- Creates accessibility issues

## Priority
Medium - Affects usability but doesn't break core functionality

## Labels
- bug
- accessibility
- frontend
- user-experience
- keyboard-navigation

# Issue #26: Fix: Edit Details button shows incorrect text when no entity is selected

**State:** OPEN
**Created:** 2025-06-02T02:20:52Z
**Updated:** 2025-06-02T13:52:02Z

## Bug Description

The "Edit Details" button remains enabled and shows incorrect text when no client or business is selected on the invoice creation page. This creates confusion as there are no details to edit in this state.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to the invoice creation page
2. Observe the client and business sections
3. When no client is selected, the button shows "Edit Details" instead of "Create Client"
4. When no business is selected, the button shows "Edit Details" instead of "Create Business"

## Expected Behavior
- When no client is selected:
  - Button should show "Create Client"
  - Button should be enabled
  - Clicking should navigate to client creation page
- When no business is selected:
  - Button should show "Create Business"
  - Button should be enabled
  - Clicking should navigate to business creation page
- "Edit Details" should only appear when an entity is selected

## Technical Details
- This is a UI state management issue
- Need to update the button text and behavior based on selection state
- May need to modify the template logic
- Consider adding proper state management for the selection status

## Impact
- Creates user confusion
- Inconsistent with standard UI patterns
- May lead to user errors

## Priority
Medium - Affects usability but doesn't break core functionality

## Labels
- bug
- frontend
- user-experience
- ui-consistency
