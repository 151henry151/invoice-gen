## Description

The "Edit Client" and "Edit Business" buttons are currently non-functional. These buttons should allow users to modify existing client and business information.

## Current Behavior

- Edit buttons are visible but do not respond to clicks
- No action is triggered when buttons are clicked
- No error messages or feedback is provided to the user

## Expected Behavior

- Clicking "Edit Client" should open a form with the client's current information
- Clicking "Edit Business" should open a form with the business's current information
- Forms should be pre-populated with existing data
- Changes should be saved and reflected in the UI after submission

## Technical Details

- Need to implement click handlers for both buttons
- Create edit forms with pre-populated data
- Implement update functionality in the backend
- Ensure proper state management for edited data

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Edit buttons respond to user clicks
- [ ] Edit forms open with pre-populated data
- [ ] Changes can be saved successfully
- [ ] UI updates to reflect changes immediately
- [ ] Error handling for failed updates
- [ ] Form validation for edited data
