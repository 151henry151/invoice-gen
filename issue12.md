## Description

The current login system does not enforce secure password requirements, which can lead to vulnerabilities. The application should be updated to require users to create and use secure passwords, enhancing overall security.

## Current Behavior

- The login system does not enforce secure password requirements.
- Users can create accounts with weak passwords, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.

## Expected Behavior

- The login system enforces secure password requirements (e.g., minimum length, inclusion of numbers, special characters, and mixed case).
- Users are prompted to create a secure password during registration.
- Feedback is provided to users if their chosen password does not meet the security criteria.
- The application securely stores and manages user credentials.

## Technical Details

- Implement password validation logic to enforce secure password requirements.
- Use appropriate libraries or tools for secure password storage (e.g., hashing and salting).
- Update the registration and login forms to reflect the new password requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Secure password requirements are enforced during registration
- [ ] Users receive feedback if their chosen password does not meet the criteria
- [ ] The application securely stores and manages user credentials
